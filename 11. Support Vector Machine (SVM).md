# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The purpose of SVM is to find the best line / prediction coundary for the classification

Each of the points can be considered a vector of several number of variables (2D for 2 var, 3D for 3 var) <br>
In this case the line searched thorugh a maximum margin

#### Speciality of SVM

Lets assume we have two classes A (red) and B (green) . A common ML problem can be specified as to find the the class prediction of an object considering the existing A and B class.<br>
We could be searching by selecting the classes are "not like" the other "at all"<br>
However, SVM considers those regions of a class that are "very much like" the other class. (i.e., A objects that behaves like B and vice versa)
Those are called the **"support vectors"** <br>
 
So SVM's are kind of like risky/rebellious type of classifiers as it looks at the "very extreme" case that are very close to the boundary, and thus using that as an analysis.
