# Eclat Algorithm

Eclat stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and Bottom-Up Lattice Traversal and it is an algorithm for association rule mining (which also regroups frequent itemset mining).

## ECLAT vs FP Growth vs Apriori
There are two methods faster than the "Apriori". <br> These are **FP Growth** and **ECLAT**. There is no obvious winner between these two. Depends on dataset.

## ECLAT Model
Just like Apriori algorithm, we have support in Eclat. However, there is no confidence or lift. <br>

support( **M** ) = # user watchlist containing "**M**" / # user watchlists

Here, M is a set of two or more movies.

## Algorithm

* **Step 1 :** List the Transaction ID (TID) set of each product<br>

* **Step 2 :** Take all the subsets of transactions having higher support than minimum support<br>

* **Step 3 :** Compute the Transaction ID set of each product pair<br>
  * We now repeat the process for "pair of products" and 
  * This step is done using the Intersection of the two original sets. This makes it different from the Apriori algorithm.
  * The ECLAT algorithm is faster because it is much simpler to identify the intersection of the set of transactions IDs than to scan each individual transaction for the presence of pairs of products (as Apriori does). 
  * The following image shows how it's easy to filter out the transaction IDs that are common between the product pair Wine and Cheese:

* **Step 4 :** Filter out pairs having more than minimum support

* **Step 5 :** Continue as long as new pairs can be made.


## Disadvantages
If the tidlist is too large, the Eclat algorithm may run out of memory. <br>
