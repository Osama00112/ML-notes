# Overfitting

A model that fits too closely to a particular data set and therefore may fail to generalize to future data.<br>

This decision boundary over fits the avaiable data too much to correctly guess the future data points, as seen above,<br>
a point may very well be a "fluke" and does not need to be cosidered in fitting.

Another example of overfitting: <br>
