# Naive Bayes

Let us consider the data points below:

### Bayes' Theorem
P(A∣B) = P(A⋂B)/P(B) = P(B∣A) * P(A) / P(B)
 
## Plan of Attack
### Step 1

Where X = features. In this case there are 2 features.

### Step 2

### Step 3

Finally we are going to compare our probabilities.

## According to the given data set:

## Step 1

### 1. Prior Probability
P(Walks) = Number of walkers / Total Observations <br>
P(Walks) = 10 / 30

### 2. Marginal Likelihood
First we are going to make a circle around our observation. <br>
Looking at all the points inside the circle, these points are "similar" in terms of features to the point that we had.<br>
Any point that falls in the vicinity is going to be deemed similar to the new data point.

P(X) = Number of similar observation / Total observation <br>
P(X) = 4 /30 

### 3. Likelihood

P(X | Walks) = Number of Similar Observations among those who walks / Total number of walkers <br>
P(X | Walks) = 3 / 10


### 4. Posterior Probability

P(Walks | X) = [ (3/10) * (10/30) ]/ (4/30) <br>
P(Walks | X) = 0.75

## Step 2

***Following similar procedure for drivers, we get***

P(Drives) = 20 / 30 <br>
P(X) = 4 /30 <br>
P(X | Drives) = 1 / 20 <br>

P(Drives | X) = 0.25

## Step 3

0.75 vs 0.25 <br>
0.75 > 0.25 <br>

its more likely for that person (data point) to walk <br>
Therefore that feature is going to be classified as "Walker"
