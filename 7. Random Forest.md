# Random Forest Tree


####  Step - 1
> Pick at random K data points from the Training set.
####  Step - 2
> Build the Decision Tree associated to these K data points.
####  Step - 3
> Choose the number Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat STEPS 1 & 2
####  Step - 4
> For a new data point, make each one of your Ntree trees predict the value of y to for the dat apoint in question,
> Assign the new data point the average across all of the predicted y values
